# Pointercrate Rules and Guidelines

This section of Pointercrate documents the guidelines that the Demon List team (the "Team") uses when handling new level placements and incoming record submissions. Please note that although these guidelines extensively cover the various aspects of the list and the Team, they are **not necessarily exhaustive** and may be updated whenever the Team feels the need to do so. These updates are enforced **immediately** after their release, so players should take care to read the *changelog __need link__* to familiarize themselves with any recent changes or additions. The Table of Contents on the right can be used to navigate to specific portions of the guidelines. 

These guidelines will always be accessible from the [Pointercrate homepage](/) as well as on the [demon list](/demonlist/). In addition, players will be reminded to refer to the restrictions specifically regarding record eligibility at the bottom of the submission form. 

If you have any questions or concerns about these guidelines, don't hesitate to contact any Team member for clarification! The raw files used to generate this webpage are also located [on github](https://github.com/stadust/demonlist-guidelines), so if you notice a typo or any other error in the guidelines shown here, feel free to submit a pull request!
