# Recording Clicks{id=clicks}

Any record that does not include audible click sounds **will be rejected**.

Additionally, click sounds **must be on their own audio track** in the raw footage (i.e., microphone audio and nothing else). If you are unable to record with multiple audio tracks, you may also choose to record your clicks without desktop audio or use another device. Records with raw footage from liveplays or mobile devices are exempt from this requirement; however, providing a recording with isolated clicks is _strongly recommended_.

Below are some examples of effective software for recording both video and clicks, though you may use other programs as well.

For PC:

- OBS [](https://youtu.be/YNlRUVk3oE8?feature=shared)
- ShadowPlay / NVIDIA App [](https://youtu.be/IP-3dJw0uMY?feature=shared)
- AMD ReLive

For Mobile:

- iOS Built-in Recorder
- Record It! (iOS)
- Android Built-in Recorder, if available
- DU Recorder (Android)
- Mobizen (Android)
- XRecorder (Android)

## Separately Recording Clicks{id=separately-recording-clicks}

Players may record clicks using a separate device such as a phone or other audio recorder. Audio recording software is also permitted; however, players are **not allowed to use Audacity** for recording clicks. Players that choose to do this should submit a Google Drive _folder_ in the "Raw Footage" field containing both the raw footage and the raw audio file.
