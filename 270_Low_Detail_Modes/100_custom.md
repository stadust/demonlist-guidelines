# Custom LDMs

Some list demons may not have a built-in LDM or an LDM on the Pointercrate account. In these cases, players may choose to create their own LDMs in a copy of the level while targeting specific parts that do not run well for them. 

Although it is not required to have these custom LDMs approved by the list team, it is *strongly recommended* to clear them with the team beforehand, especially if an LDM of the level already exists. Players should note that strong level LDMs may be considered nerfs, which violates our guidelines for [gameplay changes](/guidelines/eligibility/#gameplay).

## Custom LDM Guidelines

This subsection describes general points players should note when creating LDMs of list demons. 

For instance, a custom LDM may not *delete or otherwise alter any object that obstructs the player’s vision*. Such objects include but are not limited to fading transitions, screen flashes, and foreground decoration. 

Although no fixed limit for the amount of required detail exists, one must be careful to not allow a custom LDM to resemble a "layout" of the level. In general, *some details should be left in the block design* to avoid over-reducing the level’s decoration.

Background deletions are allowed only if their removal does not impact the gameplay. 

If a player decides to remove the end screen for a level, they should be aware of the length of the new level. The length of the original level should **never be adjusted**, for any changes would artificially alter the value of any progress obtained.

## Color Changes

Occasionally, players may encounter color combinations or flashes in a list demon that cause problems to their eyesight. Although significant changes to a level’s color scheme are not allowed (they are considered nerfs), minor color changes are permitted as long as the difficulty of the level remains the same. 

These situations are evaluated on a case by case basis, so be sure to take any color change requests to a list team member!
