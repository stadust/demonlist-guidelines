# Submitting a Record{id=submissions}

In order to submit a record, you must include a video and [raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage) that showcases yourself completing an [uncut](/guidelines/eligibility/#videoreqs) run. The progress for a submitted record on a level must also be greater than or equal to the minimum progress requirement for the level, which can be found on the level’s information screen on this website.

The video must be available on YouTube, Twitch, Vimeo, or Bilibili in order for it to be added to the list. For Twitch, highlights are the only acceptable form of video proof. The link you provide must also be a ["well-formed" URL](/documentation/index/#video). 

**Using the submission form to send records for other players is strongly discouraged.** Any user that submits a record as a joke will be banned from submitting any additional records.

## Legacy Records{id=legacy}

Records are **not** accepted for levels that have fallen into the legacy list.

A legacy record may be considered for addition if proof exists that the record was achieved before the level entered the legacy list. However, it is not possible to submit legacy records using the submission form, so players may send these to the list team is through [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/M7bDDQf). 

***All submitted records will be considered under modern submission guidelines***. As such, players should note that records that were eligible for the list at the time of completion *may not be eligible under today's standards*. **This includes the requirement for providing raw footage!**
