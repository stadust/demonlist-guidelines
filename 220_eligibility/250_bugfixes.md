# Fixing Bugs{id=bugfixes}

In Geometry Dash, gameplay features such as jump rings and ramps are known to behave differently on higher framerates. As such, a level on the list may occasionally contain gameplay that is impossible at certain FPS values. Fixing this gameplay does not affect the eligibility of a record as long as the intended difficulty is maintained *as accurately as possible*. An example of an acceptable bugfix is 1% in Arctic Lights. At higher framerates, the player falls too quickly off the opening ramp into the wall of spikes; the wall may be adjusted to allow the player to avoid it.

This guideline also applies to gameplay made unreasonably more difficult compared to the verification. An example of a possible part that is still eligible for a bugfix is 48% in Spacial Rend. The two clicks in the ball section can be buffered at most framerates, but is extremely difficult at very high FPS values. This issue did not apply to the original verification, so a bugfix is allowed for higher framerates. 
  
Despite these acceptable fixes, players should be aware of the difference between buggy gameplay and general inconsistencies!

## Illegal Bug Fixes

***Players should communicate with the list team as regularly as possible when creating custom bug fixes!*** Submitting an illegal bug fix alone is not grounds for a player ban; however, repeatedly submitting prohibited bug fixes prior to clearing them with the team *may result in a player ban*.

## Custom Speed Changes

Although this issue is not necessarily considered a “bug”, certain conditions may cause a level to desynchronize with its song, especially in longer levels. Players are allowed to add speed changes at transitions to adjust the sync of the level **if and only if all difficulty remains unchanged**. Any player that manually adds speed changes to a level *should clear it with the List Team before submitting a record*.

## Physics Changes

In updates 2.1 and 2.11, certain changes to the in-game physics made some existing levels impossible or unreasonably difficult to complete compared to the verification. One example is the trajectory of the UFO gamemode after activating a red jump ring. These bugs are generally fixable, but they are handled by the list team on a case-by-case basis.
