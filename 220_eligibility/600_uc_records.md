# Under Consideration Records{id=uc-records}

Records are marked as Under Consideration if a run is suspected to be illegitimate, if a certain aspect of a legitimate run may not be acceptable under current guidelines, or if a record cannot be thoroughly checked. If your record is marked as UC, check if the list team has contacted you for further information.

## High Suspicion 

A record may be rejected due to high suspicion of a [hacked completion](/guidelines/eligibility/#hacks), but a player **will not be banned** unless conclusive evidence of illegitimacy is found.

As such, players are encouraged to include strong indicators of a legitimate completion, such as moderate to high video quality, streams, and/or progress videos.

***A player that refuses to provide evidence to support their legitimacy when requested will be assumed to have hacked one or more completions and will be consequently banned.*** If a team member requests evidence that you do not possess, the corresponding record will likely be rejected, but a player ban will not be considered unless this repeatedly occurs.
