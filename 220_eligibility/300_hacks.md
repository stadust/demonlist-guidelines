# Eligibility of Hacks{id=hacks}

Although the list team allows certain hacks for records on the list, a player *may not submit a record obtained using hacks* designed to __alter or bypass__ the gameplay in any way. Please refer to [this section](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks) for a list of allowed hacks for records on the Demon List.

It should be noted that, per the [framerate guidelines](/guidelines/eligibility/#fps) players are **no longer** allowed to use the FPS bypass to change the in-game framerate in the middle of an attempt. Players are also **prohibited** from changing the state of other allowed hacks after the start of an attempt if this change is intended to alter the difficulty of the level. 
  
Any records involving a player enabling or disabling allowed hacks to change the difficulty of the level will be rejected!

## Mega Hack v7{id=mhv7}

In addition to using only [allowed hacks](/guidelines/miscellaneous/#allowed-hacks), users of Mega Hack v7 and above are expected to follow additional requirements:
- Cheat indicator on endscreen must remain enabled (this should be enabled by default)
- The FPS counter built into Mega Hack must be enabled

## Player Bans

***Any attempt to post an illegitimate (hacked) record while passing it off as legitimate will cause the player to be banned from the stats viewer on this website.*** 

Each ban *will be indefinite* until the player confesses to the list team and publicly identifies their illegitimate videos as hacked. In addition, a player publicly encouraging the use of any hacking methods *will be treated as if they submitted a record that used them*, so they will be banned accordingly. The length of the ban after confession is primarily dependent on the severity of the infraction, the quantity of hacked records, and any attempts to prolong the investigation. 

*A player that continues to submit illegitimate records after confessing to hacking once will be permanently banned with no exception.*

## Alternate and 'Qwer' Accounts

While not considered a hack, the list team also prohibits alternate accounts for players that have already submitted records under a different name. If a player is caught with more than one account on the list, the new account will be banned permanently, and the original account will be banned indefinitely until the owner publicly confesses.

In addition, the list team prohibits 'qwer' accounts that post records from multiple players under a single name. If multiple players are caught submitting records for a single account on the list, the group account will be banned permanently and the individual players recording the videos will be banned indefinitely until each one publicly confesses.
