# Requirements for Raw Footage{id=requiredraw}

Players should be fully aware that providing unedited raw footage with each record is ***absolutely required***. Records that do not include an accessible link to a raw footage file **will be rejected!** Even so, players should also note that having a valid raw footage file **is not a guarantee that the record will be accepted!** It is a very important part of the process, but other guidelines, including having audible clicks and showing the in-game end screen, are equally important for a record to be accepted! 

The guidelines below describe important information for uploading a video file and sharing it through the submission form. Any questions regarding these guidelines should be directed towards a team member!
  
## File Sharing

In order to verify that the raw footage is completely unedited, we ask that players use **Google Drive** to share their raw footage files with us. Even if the original file was uploaded to YouTube and then downloaded again, YouTube’s automatic video compression makes such verification unreliable. As such, **we will never accept YouTube URLs as valid raw footage for a record** unless they link to an unedited live stream. Players can share Google Drive files by following this procedure:

1. Ensure that the video file has the correct format (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, etc.)</br>
2. Right-click the video file</br>
3. Select “Get Sharable Link”</br>
4. In the pop-up menu, change “Restricted” to “Anyone with the link”</br>
5. Copy the link and include it in the “Raw Footage” submission field!</br>

Invalid raw footage links will be considered equivalent to a failure to provide raw footage, which **will** result in a rejected record. **This includes cases with Google Drive links that are not properly shared,** so players should be sure they have fully followed the above process before submitting their records! However, players can **always** reach out to us with a valid raw footage link for any rejected record, and we will promptly reconsider the submission.

### File Size

Players should not worry about file size – the most important guideline to follow is that the uploaded video is the **original file from the recording software.** A raw footage of 5 to 15 minutes at moderately high quality is usually recommended; however, there is **no maximum or minimum file size or video length** necessary for raw footage to be considered.

Videos that are exceptionally long may exceed the free Google Drive storage limit (15GB); if this is the case, please reach out to a member of the List Team for help! We have an official Gmail account for raw footage that has additional storage space, and players are permitted to log onto this account for the purposes of uploading these files. 

Please note that this account may only be used for uploading raw footage, and abuse of this system will not be tolerated. We recommend using clipping software such as OBS Replay Buffer or Shadowplay Instant Replay for players who wish to avoid large file sizes. 

## Live Streams

Players that use live streams to record their progress on a level may wish to not record a separate video file for performance purposes. In these cases, a link to the **unedited** live stream is an acceptable alternative to raw footage, but players should be prepared to prove that the stream is unedited if asked to do so! One possible method of verifying an unedited live stream is by showing a case of chat interaction.
