# Requirements for Raw Footage{id=requiredraw}

Providing unedited raw footage is ***required*** for all records. Records submitted without raw footage **will be rejected!**

Raw footage must be recorded at **30 frames per second or more**. Video quality should be high enough so that the level is easily visible.
  
## File Sharing

Players must use **Google Drive** to share their raw footage files with us. Raw footage that is not uploaded to Google Drive **will not be accepted** unless the link is to an *unedited live stream*. Players can share Google Drive files by following this procedure:

1. Ensure that the video file has the correct format (.mp4, .mov, .mkv, etc.)</br>
2. Right-click the video file</br>
3. Select “Get Sharable Link”</br>
4. In the pop-up menu, change “Restricted” to “Anyone with the link”</br>
5. Copy the link and include it in the “Raw Footage” submission field!</br>

Invalid raw footage links **will** result in a rejected record. However, players may reach out to the list team with a valid raw footage link for any rejected record.

## File Size

Raw footage of 5 to 15 minutes at moderately high quality is recommended; however, there is **no maximum or minimum file size or video length** for raw footage to be considered. Recording your entire game session is not required!

If your raw footage exceeds the free Google Drive storage limit (15GB), reach out to a member of the list team for help!

## Live Streams

A link to an **unedited** live stream is acceptable as raw footage. However, it is still recommended to submit a local recording alongside a live stream.
