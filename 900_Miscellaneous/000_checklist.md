# Player Checklist{id=checklist}

Although the [key takeaways](/guidelines/index/#takeaways) in these guidelines are still important for players to know, this checklist summarizes the most essential steps players should take to minimize any delays in getting their record approved!

- If you can, complete the level on the rated version on the servers or on an "official" copy uploaded to the Pointercrate account.<br><br>
- If you need to beat the level on a copy for any reason, clear it with the list team first! This includes but is not limited to [LDMs](/guidelines/lowdetailmodes/) and [bug fixes](/guidelines/eligibility/#bugfixes).<br><br>
- If you have an LDM that needs to be checked, please **share a NoClip run with the list team** to help us respond quickly to your request!<br><br>
- If you'd like to use a skip, check to see if it's used in a completion already accepted to the list. If not, please get it approved by the list team before proceeding!<br><br>
- Do not skip the endscreen after a completion! This will warrant an immediate rejection of your record. In addition, make sure you're not using a texture pack that makes the endscreen text hard to read.<br><br>
- Be sure to enable a readable FPS counter for all records! You may use a framerate up to 360 FPS.<br><br>
- [Raw footage](/guidelines/rawfootage/) is **required for every submission!** Be sure to provide a [shared Google Drive link](/guidelines/rawfootage#requiredraw) to avoid any delays in accepting your record.<br><br>
- It is **highly recommended** to keep your raw footage file until your record is accepted! If valid raw footage is not provided, we'll reject the record initially, but players can reach out to us to provide raw footage at any time if they have it.<br><br>
- It is **crucial** that you include clicks in your completion video or raw footage! Failing to provide clicks **guarantees** that your record will be rejected. The "Recording Clicks" section below details advice for ensuring consistently audible clicks.<br><br>
- When you include clicks in your video, be sure that they're clearly audible to the viewer! Barely audible clicks are considered equivalent to no clicks and will result in a rejected record.<br><br>
- If you're recording a liveplay (e.g. with your phone camera), be sure to have the monitor screen clearly visible in the video! Showing your input device during a liveplay is also strongly encouraged.
