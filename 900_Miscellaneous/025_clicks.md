# Recording Clicks{id=clicks}

Any record that does not include audible clicks throughout the corresponding attempt **will be rejected with no exception**, even if the lack of clicks is accidental. As such, it is important to determine a method of recording clicks that consistently works well with your playing setup!

**Before submitting a record to the list**, players should be sure to test their recording setup in order to proactively fix any issues with recording clicks. If you are having trouble with recording audible clicks, please refer to the guidelines below or contact a team member for assistance!
  
Our preferred method of recording clicks is using any recording software that can register inputs from a microphone and blend them well with background audio. The lists below provide some examples of effective software for recording clicks. You may choose to use other programs as well, but **be sure that the clicks are audible in the video file without any editing!**
  
For PC:
  
- OBS
- ShadowPlay
- Bandicam
- AMD ReLive
  
For Mobile:
  
- iOS Built-in Recorder

## Separately Recording Clicks
  
In some cases, players may not be able to record audible clicks using a video recording software. The clicks could be difficult to hear due to a quiet input device, but we will **never** force a player to change their playstyle to qualify for records on the list!

An acceptable alternative for recording clicks in these cases is **using a separate audio recorder** placed closer to the input device. This method also helps to avoid cases of inaudible clicks due to a recording glitch. **Players that choose to separately record clicks should upload a Google Drive *folder* in the "Raw Footage" field containing both the video and audio!**
  
The preferred method of recording separate audio is using an external device, such as a cell phone. Audio recording software on PC is also permitted; however, players are **not allowed to use Audacity** for recording clicks!
