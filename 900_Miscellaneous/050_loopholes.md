# Loopholes and Exceptions

## Loopholes

Although these guidelines aim to cover all things Demon List related, they are not necessarily exhaustive and may be changed in the future. Any player that attempts to evade these guidelines via a loophole in the wording of any rule will be subject to the same punishment *as if that rule was broken*.

## Guideline Exceptions

Whenever a new guideline is released, we understand that players may mistakenly overlook new policies, especially in regard to record submission.

On a case-by-case basis, the list team may decide to grant a *one-time exception* for these scenarios and inform the player of what should be done in the future. **Asking the team for an exception does not increase your likelihood of receiving one!**

*Players should be sure to monitor the [changelog](/guidelines/index/#changelog) for these guidelines to ensure that no important changes are missed!* Any major changes will also be announced in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/M7bDDQf).
